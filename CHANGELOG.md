# Changelog

## v0.3 - 2020-25-10

**To upgrade from v0.2.8 to v0.3, please: 1. delete all the Enlighten tables, 2. Re-run the migrations in your local environment, 3. Delete any published views and 4. Run `php artisan view:clear` to delete the view cache.** 

**Also make sure the `response` key in `config/enlighten.php` has the following structure:**

```
    'response' => [
        'headers' => [
            'hide' => [],
            'overwrite' => [],
        ],
        'body' => [
            'hide' => [],
            'overwrite' => [],
        ]
    ],
```

## v0.2.8 - 2020-10-16

**To upgrade from v0.2.5 to v0.2.6, please delete all the Enlighten tables and re-run the migrations in your local environment** 

- The example group URLs now show the slug of the test class names instead of the ID, for the better readability and to preserve the same URLs after re-running the tests for the same run configuration.
- Add .gitattributes to prevent tests and other unnecessary files from being published.
- Fix for issues: https://github.com/StydeNet/enlighten/issues/12 https://github.com/StydeNet/enlighten/issues/11 and https://github.com/StydeNet/enlighten/issues/8

## v0.2 - 2020-10-14

**To upgrade from v0.1 to v0.2, please delete all the Enlighten tables and re-run the migrations in your local environment**

### New features

- Support tests with multiple HTTP requests
- Show exceptions and stack trace on failed / error tests
- Show validation errors in Validation Exceptions
- Show database queries in each test example
- Show an explicit message that Enlighten requires Laravel TestCase in order to work
- Improve database name convention over configuration (learn more in README.md)
- Add "See in Enlighten" link when a test fails (doesn't work with Collision yet)
- Add search bar
- Improved generated titles for test methods that start with `test_`

### Fixes && Improvements
